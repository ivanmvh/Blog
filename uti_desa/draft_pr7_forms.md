# Blog app - Add forms

## Description
In this project we will be adding forms to our Blog app.
- Use preprocessed HTML file with embedded Ruby code.
- Use layouts and templates for shared content.


### Project requirements
-  Create a method called `current_user` in our ApplicationController to make current user data available to all controllers.
    -  It will return the first user from the database.
    -  Don't worry about proper authentication at this time. You will add it in the upcoming projects.
- Create forms to perform the following functions:
    - Creates a Post on behalf of the `current_user` (use the method that we created in our ApplicationController).
    - Create a comment on behalf of the `current_user` (use the method that we created in our ApplicationController).
- Allow Users to add likes to Posts.
