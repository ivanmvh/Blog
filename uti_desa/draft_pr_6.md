# Blog app - Views

## Description
In this project we will be adding the Views associated with the Models and Controllers we've already created for our Blog App.
- Use preprocessed HTML file with embedded Ruby code.
- Use layouts and templates for shared content.

### Project requirements
- Implement the design from the sneak peek wireframes.
    - Styling is nice to have but focus on making sure everything functions first. (Note: Ignore login logic, we would be using Devise in coming milestone)

**Note: Analyze the wireframes deeply and try to identify all the necessary elements and how a user would navigate from one page to another**

- Use methods that we have created in the [Blog App - processing data in models](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-rails/blob/main/blog-app/projects/Processing_data_model_project.md).
- **Hint:** In order to see some posts or comments, we might need to add some data to our database as described [here](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-rails/blob/main/blog-app/projects/Processing_data_model_project.md#use-models-to-insert-data).

### General requirements (Don't forget)
- Make sure that there are no linter errors.
- Make sure that we used correct flow Gitflow.
- Make sure that we documented our work in a professional way.
- Follow our list of best practices for Ruby.
